In this project i discovered OpenGL Library with C programming language,
I had an idea of Creating a drone that can move in a limited area.
I created the drone and some obstacles that makes the user sees the movement while he is controlling the drone around and change the camera view.
This project is not so advanced, there is just the basic commands,
to run the project make the makefile.
Movements : 
Z: move to front 
S: Move to back
Q: move to left
D: move to right
R: move up
F: move down
V: move to the initial place

View : 
V : Drone Camera 
G : main camera 
arrow keys : camera angle
B : white blend
